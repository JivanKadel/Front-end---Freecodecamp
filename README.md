I've tried implementing the Responsive web design projects included in the freecodecamp course.
Basic styling is applied.
HTML, icons and images are imported or downloaded, and are same as the project.
You can find the projects <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">here</a>.
